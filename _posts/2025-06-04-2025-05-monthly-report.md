## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Project update

The past month of development was mostly focused on community outreach,
with a talk from Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur at RustWeek in Utrecht,
available
[here](https://www.youtube.com/live/3clGDj1QR6A?si=hMnbr2QOveW1EIDa&t=18393).
Here, we met with Miguel Ojeda from the Rust-for-Linux project, who
informed us that the kernel no longer relies on the `alloc` standard
crate for its function. This makes our job easier, as we are now tasked
with compiling `core` and the kernel's implementation of `alloc`, rather
than having to catch up with the standard library's `alloc` crate.

In practice, this means that `gccrs` should be useful for Rust-for-Linux
in a shorter span of time than originally planned, and we will start
integrating the kernel's source code to our testing infrastructure in
our efforts to target those crates. We spent some time last month
establishing these milestones, which will be worked on as part of a
further 6 months of support from [Open Source Security,
inc](https://opensrcsec.com/), until the end of Stage 1 for GCC 16.1.

Our next efforts will focus on finishing our name resolution pass for
`core`, and fixing the remaining macro expansion bugs. As part of Google
Summer of Code, we will work on improving our pattern matching backend
which will allow us to covers all of the patterns used in `core`. Once
that work is complete, we will spend time exploring the `Pin` semantics
and making sure `gccrs` handles them correctly, as this data structure
is used everywhere in the Linux kernel. This will then allow us to start
testing the compiler on the kernel crates, hopefully by the end of the
summer.

Work also continued on the name resolution rewrite, which is now
frustratingly close to replacing our previous implementation. We are
resuming work on all areas of the compiler in June. The project received
contributions from the usual suspects, with around 25 pull requests from
external contributors this month. We are also starting work with our two
GSoC students, Zhi Heng and Ryutaro Okada. They will be working on
improving our pattern matching backend and on reimplementing certain
Rust lints within our front-end rather than by depending on the GCC
common compiler framework.

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 9th of June at 9am
UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be
held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to
sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

## Planned Activities

-   Merge fixes in 15.2
-   Continue working towards getting more features in 15.2

### Risks

We must establish the list of GCC-common changes we need, as we will
have to send them upstream before the start of Stage 3 around November.
This is the only risk which could incur further problems and prevent
more gccrs features from landing in 16.1.
