## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Project update

We took some time this month to put together a document outlining the
future of the project, like we had done last year. [This
document](https://hackmd.io/pJQAETRsSym8KG0TFuSnhw?view) allowed us to
establish smaller milestones, and to create a dependency graph in
between these milestones. This, as well as an estimate of the time to
complete for each issue, allows us to put together a Gantt chart which
gives us start and target dates for each of the milestones. The purpose
of this document is to evolve as time passes, and to reflect on our
progress around the release of GCC 15.1, in one year of work.

To establish this document, we spent multiple hours painstakingly
compiling each module of the `core` and `alloc` crates, hacking around
the missing imports and dependencies in order to go as far as possible
into the compiler pipeline, in the hope of unearthing new issues with
the compiler. Because we attempted to compile each module separately,
imports were not handled properly and we had to re-define huge chunks of
the `core` library each time, making the progress very slow. However, as
the high number of issues opened this month will show, this work is
proving to be worthwile and gives us a clearer picture of the situation
for our objectives of compiling the Rust standard library and the
Rust-for-Linux project.

Speaking about Rust-for-Linux (RfL), Miguel Ojeda and Arthur had a great
conversation regarding the state of the compiler and future goals of the
Rust language concerning the kernel. For example, RfL no longer needs
its own fork of the `alloc` crate - meaning that once we are able to
catch up and compile the Rust standard library, we should have no issues
providing this dependency to RfL. Furthermore, [one of the goals of the
Rust project for
2024](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2024h2/rfl_stable.html)
is to enable RfL to compile using a stable compiler, which should help
us when catching up to the Rust version the kernel expects, as it will
drop requirements for nightly features we might not have implemented.

Regarding GSoC, we are very impressed with the work done by our students
so far. As they all had important commitments, such as internships or
exams, they chose to start working on their project early and have done
oustandingly. We are looking forward to more progress and we can't wait
to show you the cool features they are building.

On the technical side of things, we have started progressing towards the
next milestones already. Internal compiler attributes are being handled,
work has started on fixing some bugs discovered in our support of
negative trait implementations (used in quite a few places in `core`
1.49), parser improvements are being worked on for `alloc` and `std`,
and as usual, a lot of code is being cleaned up and improved
continuously. Our GCC build system patch has now been reviewed, and the
review comments adressed - meaning that upstreaming will start again
shortly, and that GCC's trunk will be in sync with our development
repository. We are also working towards getting documentation in for GCC
14.2, which should release in the next few months.

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 17th of June at 9am
UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be
held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to
sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

## Call for contribution

-   [Issue 3001: Generic arguments are not disambiguated on error
    propagation
    expressions](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/3001)

Our error propagation expressions (expressions which use the question
mark operator, of the form `<expr>?`) are currently forgotten in many of
our AST visitors. As a result, there are unexpected cases when it comes
to various parts of the compiler pipeline handling them. In that
particular case, the function call's generic arguments are not
disambiguated - the compiler does not know if it needs to be handling a
generic type, or a const generic value. You will need to add handling to
our name resolution pass for these error propagation expressions. It
would be helpful to look at [the current generic
disambiguation](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/75049a3bfee8c3f888994bce3b741a805c631c2a/gcc/rust/resolve/rust-ast-resolve-type.cc#L568)
to start figuring out where it is called from, and where you need to
call it.
