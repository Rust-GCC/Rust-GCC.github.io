## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Project update

GCC development entered stage 3 this month, meaning that `gccrs` is no
longer allowed to submit patches that affect the entire GCC framework
until the project re-enters stage 1, after the release of GCC 15.1. This
is not an issue for us, as we took special care to send the affected
patches upstream back in June of this year, giving them plenty of time
to get reviewed and merged before stage 3. In other GCC news, the
baseline for building the compiler got bumped from GCC 4.8 to GCC 5.4 -
this means that the oldest compiler that we are expected to target is
newer and adds support for C++14. Thanks to [Sam
James](https://github.com/thesamesam) and [Marc
Poulhi√®s](https://github.com/dkm), we have updated our CI to reflect
this change. Thank you both!

Most of the pull-requests this month were focused on name resolution,
with even more improvements made by [Owen
Avery](https://github.com/powerboat9). Owen has been a contributor to
the project for two years, and has been extremely helpful recently with
our name resolution rewrite (NR2.0), by working on integrating it to all
areas of the compiler. We will thus be welcoming Owen to the core
`gccrs` team of contributors.

An interesting technical change this month concerns the type-checking of
`match` expressions. In one certain case, `match` expressions can
resolve to the `never` type. This is interesting for empty \~enum\~s,
which can be used to represent invalid or impossible states. A well
known type from the standard library is
[Infallible](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/enum.Infallible.html),
whose definition is as follows:

``` rust
enum Infallible {}
```

Since this `enum` does not contain any variants, matching on it looks a
bit strange:

``` rust
fn handle_infallible(x: Infallible) {
    let y = match x {};
}
```

In that case, what should the type of `y` be? Since we cannot extract
any information from `x`, it doesn't really make sense to give `y` a
regular type. Furthermore, since we cannot instantiate a value of type
`Infallible` in the first place, it does not make sense to do
pattern-matching on it to extract information! But by making this
pattern matching resolve to the `never` type, we can implement traits on
`Infallible` in order to use it just like a regular error type - since
`never` can always coerce to any target type, as it cannot exist in the
first place. This makes empty pattern matching required for handling the
`Infallible` type and its trait implementations, which is required for
handling code that can never fail. The documentation of the `enum` gives
an interesting example, in which the `TryFrom<T>` trait can be
implemented for `U` when `U` already implements `From<T>`. Because we
know the conversion can never fail, there is no need to expose a proper
error type, as those errors will never show up.

The fix for this is quite simple - if the `match` we are type-checking
is empty, then we can just resolve its type to `never`. If the match is
not supposed to be empty (for example, if we are matching on an `enum`
with one or more variants), then it's up to the exhaustiveness checker
to report an issue - not the type-checker!

If you are curious, you can see how this special case is handled in
[gccrs](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/afbd87358cc8b4627536145510b0c17634005eb6/gcc/rust/typecheck/rust-hir-type-check-expr.cc#L1461-L1468)
and in
[rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3d1dba830a564d1118361345d7ada47a05241f45/compiler/rustc_hir_typeck/src/_match.rs#L32-L36).

In other technical news, [Antoni Boucher](https://github.com/antoyo),
lead developer of the `rustc_codegen_gcc` project, contributed code to
`gccrs` this month in order to improve target feature detection for both
of our projects. This code concerns platform-specific information that
the compilers needs to know about in order to produce correct assembly.
By reusing the same code in both projects, we ensure that Rust code
compiled using one of the GCC-based compilers will behave the same way
on the users' machines. This change also makes it easier to adapt our
target configuration values for Rust if the need arises. Thank you
Antoni!

Finally, a blogpost written in collaboration with the Rust project was
also published on the official Rust blog:
<https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/11/07/gccrs-an-alternative-compiler-for-rust.html>.
This blogpost outlines some of the decisions we've made for `gccrs` to
make sure that the project does not threaten the Rust ecosystem and does
not risk splitting it in two. The main discussion thread about it can be
found [here on
Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1gm51ki/gccrs_an_alternative_compiler_for_rust_rust_blog/),
where it was really well-received.

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 9th of December at
10am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one
will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like
to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

## Call for contribution

There are no calls for contribution this month, as we do not have a lot
of good first issues available. Still, feel free to take a look at them
[here](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-pr)
