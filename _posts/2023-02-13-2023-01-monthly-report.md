## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Milestone Progress

This month saw an influx of new contributors and pull-requests, which we
are extremely happy about. We have opened multiple issues marked as
`good-first-pr` in order to make sure that anyone interested in the
project is able to get started. Incidentally, this also caused us to
start looking at enhancing the contributing experience regarding GCC
ChangeLogs and restrictions earlier than planned. This is fine, as most
of the infrastructure was already in place for our work on upstreaming
patches to GCC's master branch. Overall, more than 60 pull-requests were
merged this month, with 8 new people contributing to the project!

As a consequence, our continuous integration now checks whether or not
your commits contain the proper format of Changelog and respect the
Digital Certificate of Origin or were made under an FSF copyright
assignment. We are putting together more "interactive" to make it easier
for first time contributors to create these ChangeLog entries.

We also submitted our list of Google Summer of Code projects, which you
can find [here on the GCC wiki](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SummerOfCode),
in the Rust frontend section. We put together four different projects,
two of them being "short" (175 hours) and the rest being "long" (350
hours) projects.

The project also made the trip to FOSDEM at the beginning of February to
give a talk to the Rust devroom about some internal workings of the
compiler. You can find the recording of that talk [here, on the FOSDEM
website](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/rust_a_deep_dive_inside_the_rust_frontend_for_gcc/).

Finally, the most important news for the project this month is the
arrival of [Pierre-Emmanuel Patry](https://github.com/P-E-P/) as a full
time contributor to the project. Pierre-Emmanuel is joining us as part
of his final year internship for his Masters degree, and will be mostly
working on our procedural macros. Notably, his work will consist in
working on a reimplementation of `libproc_macro` as well as the various
infrastructure surrounding that crate, such as inter process
communication and client/server behavior within the compiler.

### Community call

### Milestones Progress

We are putting together milestones regarding projects such as libproc
and will update the Milestone.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not
representative: It shows a 69% completion rate, but does not take into
account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items. Thus the
percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done
divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall. Similarly, the
Update GCC's master branch milestone contains a [tracking
issue](https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/issues/1705) containing over
200 tasks. The percentage shown here takes this into account.

### Testing project

The testing project is on hold as we try and figure out some of the
issues we're running into with GitHub and our various automations around
it.

## Planned Activities

- Finish patch upstreaming
