## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Milestone Progress

All of the required "common part" patches were reviewed this month and
subsequently pushed to GCC's `trunk` branch. This allows us to move
forward with updating upstream with the latest changes of our
development repository. The commits are currently being tested once
again one last time before a final push, which should happen this week.
We will then resume work on the final parts of name resolution and
handling of `format_args!()`, in order to support the required features
for the GCC 14.1. release.

Progress on the compiler itself slowed down this month due to holidays.
Both issues we had mentioned in our "Call for Contribution" section last
month are being worked on, which is great. Thanks a lot for the interest
in our project.

[Jakub](https://github.com/jdupak)'s work on the borrow checker is
continuing, with even more facts being emitted correctly and more
invalid code being caught:

``` rust

fn invalid_move() {
    // note that `A` is not `Copy`
    struct A {
        i: i32,
    }

    let a = A { i: 1 };
    let b = a; // a is moved here for the first time
    let c = a; //~ ERROR `a` moved here for the second time
}

fn valid_move() {
    let a = 1; // integers are `Copy`, so this is allowed
    let b = a;
    let c = a;
}

// runtime condition invalid move
fn test_move_conditional(b1: bool, b2:bool) {
    struct A {
        i: i32
    }

    let a = A { i: 1 }; // `A` cannot be copied

    if b1 {
        let b = a; // `a` might be moved here for the first time
    }
    if b2 {
        let c = a; // `a` might be moved here for the second time
    }
}
```

The work done by Jakub is also starting to enforce proper lifetime
bounds:

``` rust

fn lifetime_return_invalid<'a, 'b>(x: &'a u32, y: &'b u32) -> &'a u32 {
    y //~ ERROR 
}

fn lifetime_return_valid<'a, 'b>(x: &'a u32, y: &'b u32) -> &'a u32
    where 'b: 'a
{
    y
}

```

And can handle complex expressions and borrow situations:

``` rust

struct Reference<'a> {
    value: &'a i32,
}

impl<'a> Reference<'a> {
    fn new<'a>(value: &'a i32) -> Reference<'a> {
        Reference { value }
    }
}

fn mutable_borrow_while_immutable_borrowed_struct() {
    let x = 0;
    let y = Reference::new(&x);
    let z = &mut x; //~ ERROR
    let w = y;
}
```

We are looking forward to more progress on this side of the compiler, as
it is an extremely important part of the Rust programming language - it
is absolutely necessary that a borrow checker exists for Linux
developers to start working in Rust using `gccrs`. Note that Jakub is
currently finishing studying for his Master's Degree and is looking for
sponsorship to continue his work on the borrow checker. Please get in
touch if you or your company would be interested in funding his work!

Finally, Pierre-Emmanuel, Philip and Arthur will all be present at
FOSDEM 2024. We are excited to meet everyone in both the Rust and GCC
rooms.

### Community call

We will not have our monthly community call this month as we are
preoccupied with upstreaming patches. You can subscribe to our calendar
to see when the next one will be held. The call is open to everyone,
even if you would just like to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe
to our [mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or
join our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

## Call for contribution

This is a new section for particularly easy or interesting issues we
would like folks external to the project to contribute to. We are
available for mentoring and guiding you on their resolution. This is a
great way to start making your mark on a complex project such as this
one and to learn a lot in the process!

-   No fields in initializer - Internal Compiler Error [Issue
    2389](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/2389)

When an instance of a struct is created with missing fields, the
compiler should error out and report an error - indicating which fields
are missing (<https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0063.html>). This
is currently unimplemented in `gccrs`, and working on this issue will
enable you to look at multiple parts of the compiler such as error
reporting and typechecking.

-   Missing type error on function pointers with different ABIs [Issue
    2034](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/2034)

`gccrs` should produce an error when passing a function pointer argument
with a different ABI than the one expected. It is a simple check to add
into our typechecker, as we already encode all necessary ABI information
in our HIR.

Check out our [Contributing
guidelines](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to get started on them or feel free to send us a message on Zulip or
IRC!
