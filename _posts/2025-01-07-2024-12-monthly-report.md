### Project update

This month of development was focused on three major milestones of
compiler development: auto traits, built-in macros and for-loops, which
are all important in order to compile `core 1.49` and later, the
Rust-for-Linux project.

The most widely known auto traits in Rust may be [Send and
Sync](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/send-and-sync.html), which are
used all throughout the Rust standard library to indicate thread-safety.
As such, these traits are often used in trait-bounds to restrict sharing
behavior to thread-safe objects:

``` rust
trait Foo {
    fn foo(&self);
}

struct Safe;

// We cannot send pointers safely between threads
struct NonThreadSafe(*const i32);

impl Foo for Safe { fn foo(&self) { } }
impl Foo for NonThreadSafe { fn foo(&self) { } }

fn take_foo(foo: &(dyn Foo)) {
    foo.foo();
}

fn take_thread_safe_foo(foo: &(dyn Foo + Send + Sync)) {
    foo.foo();
}

fn main() {
    let s = Safe;

    let i = 15;
    let n_s = NonThreadSafe(&i as *const i32);

    take_foo(&s);
    take_foo(&n_s);

    take_thread_safe_foo(&s);
    take_thread_safe_foo(&n_s);
}
```

which errors out with the following:

``` rust

8  | struct NonThreadSafe(*const i32);
   |        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = note: required for the cast from `&NonThreadSafe` to `&dyn Foo + Send + Sync`
```

Part of our pipeline was lacking support for these automatic trait
bounds, which now enables us to build this code properly. Two missing
features remain for properly handling these special bounds:

1.  Additional trait bounds can only be automatic traits

We have to restrict the usage of additional trait bounds to auto traits
exclusively, as `rustc` does:

``` rust
fn takes_only_clone_copy_and_fromstr(a: &(dyn Clone + Copy + FromStr)) {}
```

will give out the following error:

``` rust
error[E0225]: only auto traits can be used as additional traits in a trait object
  --> src/main.rs:16:55
   |
16 | fn takes_only_clone_copy_and_fromstr(a: &(dyn Clone + Copy + FromStr)) {}
   |                                               -----   ^^^^ additional non-auto trait
   |                                               |
   |                                               first non-auto trait
   |
   = help: consider creating a new trait with all of these as supertraits and using that trait here instead: `trait NewTrait: Clone + Copy + FromStr {}`
   = note: auto-traits like `Send` and `Sync` are traits that have special properties; for more information on them, visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/special-types-and-traits.html#auto-traits>
```

<https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/error_codes/E0225.html>

We must add additional logic to our typechecker in order to check for
these bounds, and make sure that the additional bounds we resolve to
only refer to auto traits - otherwise, error out with an appropriate
error message. This isn't a terribly difficult feature to add, but it
does require a bit of experience with our type system.

1.  Implementing Send and Sync properly

Finally, we must implement the `Send` and `Sync` traits properly, and
auto traits in general, so that they are applied automatically unless
you opt out of it. One major difficulty comes from having to
automatically opt-out types that contains other opted-out types, like in
the following example:

``` rust
#![feature(auto_traits)]
#![feature(negative_impls)]

auto trait MegaAuto {}

struct S;

impl !MegaAuto for S {}

struct S_Wrap(S);

fn take_mega_auto(a: &dyn MegaAuto) {}

fn main() {
    let a = S;
    let b = S_Wrap(S);

    take_mega_auto(&a);
    take_mega_auto(&b);
}
```

which errors out with the following information:

``` rust

error[E0277]: the trait bound `S: MegaAuto` is not satisfied
  --> src/main.rs:18:20
   |
18 |     take_mega_auto(&a);
   |                    ^^ the trait `MegaAuto` is not implemented for `S`
   |
   = note: required for the cast from `&S` to `&dyn MegaAuto`

error[E0277]: the trait bound `S: MegaAuto` is not satisfied in `S_Wrap`
  --> src/main.rs:19:20
   |
19 |     take_mega_auto(&b);
   |                    ^^ within `S_Wrap`, the trait `MegaAuto` is not implemented for `S`
   |
note: required because it appears within the type `S_Wrap`
  --> src/main.rs:10:8
   |
10 | struct S_Wrap(S);
   |        ^^^^^^
   = note: required for the cast from `&S_Wrap` to `&dyn MegaAuto`
```

This will be a lot more involved, and will require important changes to
our type system.

The rest of the month was focused on for-loops and built-in derive
macros, which first required a major refactor of our AST and HIR. The
problem is as follows: for-loops desugar using the following pattern:

``` rust
for <pattern> in <iterator> {
  <body>
}

// becomes

{
    let result = match ::std::iter::IntoIterator::into_iter(<iterator>) {
        mut iter => {
            loop {
                let mut __next;
                match ::std::iter::Iterator::next(&mut iter) {
                    ::std::option::Option::Some(val) => __next = val,
                    ::std::option::Option::None => break
                };
                let <pattern> = __next;
                <body>;
            }
        }
    };
    result
}
```

The paths used in this desugaring are a bit special, as they all start
with a leading `::`. [This is used to indicate that the first path
segment should refer to an external crate, and that the path should
resolve in one of these
crates](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/paths.html#path-qualifiers).
This is very useful to prevent ambiguity: If a user were to define their
own `std` module, with an inner `option` module and an `Option` enum,
simply using the `std::option::Option` path would resolve to this
instead of the expected standard enum.

If for some reason this user-defined enum were to be different, the
desugared code would not work, and you would end up with cryptic errors.
But since the path is required to resolve in the extern crate `std`,
there are no issues. *However*, `gccrs` cannot yet compile the standard
library, or distribute it and link it to each program being compiled.
Meaning that we would never be able to resolve those paths, at least
until we get to compile the standard library. But the standard library
contains for-loops, so we're in a real pickle.

Thankfully, those specific paths used for desugars or macro expansions
often refer to specific items that the compiler knows about: [lang
items](https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/language-features/lang-items.html).
By instead using "lang item paths", we can refer to these specific items
and enum variants to properly desugar our for-loops. But these paths are
extremely different from regular, segmented paths, and required a big
refactor of both our AST and HIR. Which then allowed us to almost
complete the desugaring of for-loops, and improve our handling of
built-in macros - another kind of compiler expansion that makes use of
lang items you probably already know about, such as `Copy` or `Clone`.

We still have a few built-in derives to properly implement in order to
support all of them, and close out the `Macro expansion` milestone of
the project. These built-in derives are used all throughout `std`, and
throughout most Rust code, meaning they are essential for compiling the
Rust standard library.

### Risks

We have now entered Stage 3 of GCC development, and all of the patches
we needed to get upstreamed have been upstreamed. The risk present in
this table is no longer present.
