## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Milestone Progress

A lot of progress was done in almost all areas of the compiler this
month, with improvements being done on all stages of our pipeline: our
GSoC student [Raiki Tamura](https://github.com/tamaroning) made some
significant changes to the lexer and added multiple routines around
unicode handling. Furthermore, they are bringing a Unicode Normalization
generator to the compiler, allowing us to easily keep up to date with
the latest Unicode standard. [Mahad
Muhammad](https://github.com/mahadmuhammad), on the other hand, keeps
dwelving into the guts of the compiler, looking for error codes to add
and raising issues as they go. Both of these works are extremely useful
as we get closer and closer to attempting to run the `rustc` testsuite.
Both students had their mid-term evaluation this month, and passed it
with flying colors. Congratulations both! And thank you for your
continued work.

We are also getting a lot of contributions from [Owen
Avery](https://github.com/powerboat9), who has done an amazing job
cleaning up some of the older, unecessary abstractions still present in
the compiler. [Marc Poulhiès](https://github.com/dkm) merged his new HIR
dump visitor, which is proving to be very helpful for debugging this
stage of the compilation pipeline, which Philip is working on to get the
last few bits of iterators working. Keeping on the HIR side of things,
[Jakub Dupak](https://github.com/jdupak) has started their work on facts
generation for the `polonius-engine` library, which will help in
bringing borrow-checking to the compiler. This work is extremely
experimental, but they are making good progress and we are excited to
see where it goes! On the other hand of the compiler, Arthur and
Pierre-Emmanuel are working on the new name resolution algorithm, which
is proving to be time-consuming but extremely rewarding. The new
resolver code is simple and should be easy to maintain. We have
completed the work necessary for macro name resolution, an important
part of the "early" name resolution in Rust, and are now working to
complete procedural macro resolution. At the same time, Philip and
Arthur will start work on "late" name resolution, plugging together our
new resolver and the existing typechecker where necessary. Once these
last few steps will be completed, we should be in a very good position
to succesfully compile Rust's 1.49 core library.

In total, the work this month totaled 88 pull-requests merged. This is
an extremely impressive number, and one of the highest we have had since
the beginning of the project. The team is extremely thankful to all the
contributors, and to all of the amazing people we get to interact with.

In other news, the GCC project has published a Code of Conduct, which
the `gccrs` project adopted. If you remember, we were previously using
the Rust Project's Code of Conduct, which suited us nicely. During the
last community meeting, we reviewed the new Code of Conduct and decided
to switch to it, as it contains similar community requirements. We are
also getting ready for conference season, during which we plan on giving
two talks: one at the [GNU
Cauldron](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/cauldron2023) in Cambridge at the end
of September, and one in Brussels for [EuroRust](https://eurorust.eu) in
October. We hope to meet a lot of people once again!

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 14th of August 2023.
You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be held.
The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to sit-in and
listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

### Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not
representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into
account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items. Thus the
percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done
divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall. Similarly, the
Update GCC's master branch milestone contains a [tracking
issue](https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/issues/1705) containing over
200 tasks. The percentage shown here takes this into account.

### HIR Dump

We now have a great starting point to a working HIR dump. It does not
conform directly to Rustc but we don't need it to. We have desperatly
needed this for quite some time to help newer developers debug in the
backend code generation as well as the typesystem and HIR lints. The HIR
contains a bunch of mapping information and these ID's are crucial to
help with debugging issues.

We will be making changes to this going forward but having a starting
point gives us the chance to move forward.

### More error codes

This month saw us adding these error codes to our diagnostics:

1.  E0572
2.  E0571
3.  E0268
4.  E0045
5.  E0323
6.  E0423
7.  E0133
8.  E0658
9.  E0093
10. E0124
11. E0070
12. E0063
13. E0045
14. E0053
15. E0046
16. E0061
17. E0229
18. E0034

With the continued push forward with more error codes each week it shows
GCC Rust is able to catch errors at the right points to emit these error
codes. Lots have already been added this is just the list for this
month.

### Fix ICE with return expression outside of context

This was a nice bug to fix because you can't return outside of a
function context.

``` rust
const FOO: u32 = return 0; 
```

This was an access to an empty stack which would not have been allowed
if we wrote this in Rust. We now emit

``` rust
test.rs:1:18: error: return statement outside of function body
    1 | const FOO: u32 = return 0;
      |                  ^~~~~~
```

### Fix ICE when using full path to enum variant as part of a TypePath

It is not allowed to use the variant of an enum as a Type, rust enforces
that you must use the Enum itself as a type. For example

``` rust
enum Dragon {
    Born,
}

fn oblivion() -> Dragon::Born {
    Dragon::Born
}
```

We now emit:

``` rust
test.rs:5:26: error: expected type, found variant of Dragon
    5 | fn oblivion() -> Dragon::Born {
      |                          ^~~~
```

### Sized marker trait

In Rust all generic type parameters implement the Sized marker trait by
default. This means for an example such as:

``` rust
fn foo<T>(a:T) -> X { ... }
```

Will always get turned into:

``` rust
#[lang = "sized"]
pub trait Sized {}

fn foo<T: Sized>(a:T) -> X { ... }
```

Types such as Slices, Dyn traits do not implement sized so we need to
use the special syntax of ?Sized to remove the Sized trait obligation

``` rust
#[lang = "sized"]
pub trait Sized {}

pub trait Trait {
    fn foo(&self) -> Self
    where
        Self: Sized;
}

pub fn static_foo<T: Trait + ?Sized>(_b: &T) {}

pub fn dynamic_bar(a: &dyn Trait) {
    static_foo(a)
}
```

Note in the example, Trait's define an implicit Self type parameter
which does not implemented Sized by default. This is because it would
cause a recursive trait obligation for Sized to be defined on the Self
for the Sized trait itself.

This is a key milestone for gccrs as it lays the groundwork to support
the other major marker-trait of Drop. As the Sized trait is so intrinsic
to Rust this has enforced us to update most of the testsuite to include
this marker-trait.

### Track Fn trait fn<sub>onceoutput</sub>

In order to setup the Output associated type we can rely on using
generic argument bindings. So for example when we have the FnOnce trait:

``` rust
#[lang = "fn_once"]
pub trait FnOnce<Args> {
    #[lang = "fn_once_output"]
    type Output;

    extern "rust-call" fn call_once(self, args: Args) -> Self::Output;
}
```

Then we might have a function such as:

``` rust
pub fn map<R, F: FnOnce(T) -> R>(self, f: F) -> Option<R> { ... }
```

For this trait bound predicate of FnOnce(T) -\> R we use syntactic sugar
to setup generics for the bound as if it was just another generic trait
such as:

FnOnce\<(T), Output=R\>

Note the argument T is wrapped up implicitly inside a Tuple this keeps
the type system consistent so you don't need to have specific traits for
numbers of arguments. Resuing argument binding means we can reuse our
generic argument handling to get this support for free which is then
consistent across the compiler.
