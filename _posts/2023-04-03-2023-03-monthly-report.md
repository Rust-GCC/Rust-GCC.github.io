## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Milestone Progress

We have received many GSoC proposals over the past few weeks and are
starting to review them in more detail. Remember, proposals are open
until the 4th of April, and will be reviewed until the 27th of April. We
kept on receiving a high number of contributions this month, with around
50 PRs submitted, reviewed and merged in three weeks. Please note that
why this amount is lower than previous months, this report was also
written and published a week earlier than past months. Out of 13
proposals submitted to the GSoC portal so far, 9 of them concern
`gccrs`.

We have opened many issues pertaining to the compilation of
`libcore 1.49` and feel confident that we are getting closer and closer
to compiling it. However, due to the GCC staging process, we will not be
able to make the changes required to the build system for `libcore` to
be distributed as part of GCC 13, nor will we have a completely working
version of libcore at this point. In the last few weeks that remain
before GCC 13 releases, we will not be able to implement some of the
more complex features remaining, such as inline assembly, format string
parsing and handling, or the remaining compiler builtins.

For this reason, we have chosen to go with quite an early cutoff for the
GCC 13 release, which means we'll have more time to focus on
documentation and user experience for the GCC 13 release. We will spend
some time in the coming weeks upstreaming commits to GCC's master and
figuring out our next steps for the compiler.

Arthur also spent one week this month at Embedded World talking about
the project with many interesting people from different backgrounds.
Thank you to everyone who stopped by or attended our little Rust
compilation challenge. We had pleasant discussions around `gccrs` with
individuals from AdaCore and Ferrous Systems and had a lovely time.

Finally, one of the big changes this month was the renaming of our
compiler proper from `rust1` to `crab1`. The compiler **proper** is
different from the compiler **driver**, `gccrs`, which users interact
with. Because only `gccrs` hackers will ever interact with the compiler
**proper**, we thought it would be fun to change its name. The project
was originally started as a hobby and passion project, and we think that
keeping things light is an important aspect of it. Hence, if you do
contribute to `gccrs`, you'll now use `gcc/crab1` instead of `gcc/rust1`
to see if your changes have taken into effect!

### Community call

We had our monthly community call on the 3rd of April. You can subscribe
to our calendar to see when the next one will be held. The call is open
to everyone, even if you would just like to sit-in and listen. You can
also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of

### Milestones Progress

We are putting together milestones regarding projects such as libproc
and will update the Milestone.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not
representative: It shows a 69% completion rate, but does not take into
account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items. Thus the
percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done
divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall. Similarly, the
Update GCC's master branch milestone contains a [tracking
issue](https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/issues/1705) containing over
200 tasks. The percentage shown here takes this into account.

### Risks

The last remaining risk was for gccrs to not get merged in GCC 13 by us
missing the stage deadline, but that is no longer the case.

### Testing project

The testing project is on hold as we try and figure out some of the
issues we're running into with GitHub and our various automations around
it.

## Planned Activities

-   Finish patch upstreaming
-   Finish macro name resolution
-   libproc
-   Iterators and Bugs

## Detailed changelog

### Bare trait objects

During testing libcore code we found that we didn't support bare trait
objects where it does not specify the 'dyn' keyword:
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/edition-guide/rust-2021/warnings-promoted-to-error.html#bare_trait_objects>

This is depreciated code but we aiming to compile older versions of
libcore first so we need to be able to handle this before this became a
hard error.

``` rust
trait Foo {
    fn bar(&mut self, other: &mut Foo);
}

struct Baz;
impl Foo for Baz {
    fn bar(&mut self, other: &mut Foo) {}
}
```

### Reference patterns

One of our new contributors [Mahmoud Adel](https://github.com/goar5670)
has been working on adding support for patterns within gccrs. Reference
patterns was added recently which allows the users to automatically
destructure the reference parameters here to their element types without
requiring dereference syntax.

``` rust
fn foo (&a: &i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
  a + b
}
```

### Use declarations as the Rustc prelude

When working with Result and Option gccrs did not support the prelude
use declarations which meant you had to specify Option::Some or
Result::Ok rather than the usual Ok and Some. In order to support this
Rust uses a special decalration to add these enum variant names directly
to the namespace so for exmaple:

``` rust
pub use result::Result::{self, Err, Ok};

extern "C" {
    fn printf(s: *const i8, ...);
}

mod result {
    pub enum Result<T, E> {
        #[lang = "Ok"]
        Ok(T),

        #[lang = "Err"]
        Err(E),
    }
}

pub fn test(a: i32) -> Result<i32, bool> {
    if a > 5 {
        Ok(123)
    } else {
        Err(false)
    }
}
```

Due to the use declaration it is now ok to directly use Err and Ok
without specifying Result::\<variant\> directly.

### Renaming our compiler proper from rust1 to crab1

This is an important change going forward to remember to have fun. For
those who are not aware when you invoke gcc to compile C code fro
example you should try doing so but pass the '-v' flag and you will see
that it ends up invoking a program called 'cc1'. For gccrs we used to
invoke one called rust1 we have now renamed this 'crab1'.

See our zulip for fun discussions on this and associated PR
<https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/1988>

### Add length checks for tuple patterns

When assigning tuples and patterns in general we did not have any sized
checks so it used to be possible to assign a pattern of differing sizes
which would lead to UB and or and ICE. Thanks to one of our new
contributors [Nikos Alexandris](https://github.com/nikos-alexandris) we
now have proper checks such as:

``` rust
fn foo() -> i32 { // { dg-error "expected .i32. got .bool." }
    let (a, _) = (true, 2, 3); // { dg-error "expected a tuple with 3 elements, found one with 2 elements" }
    a
}
```

see: <https://godbolt.org/z/3njj6K14j>

### Uninit intrinsic

Although we add intrinsics fairly regularly this one is interesting from
a compiler perspective, sometimes you just need uninitilized memory
which is used in the mem::ptr modules in libcore which gets called from
the iterator code to swap data around for the next element. We got some
advice from bjorn3 here on our zulip which suggests the best way to
implement an uninit intrinsic is to memset with 0x01 as it seems to be
the least dangerous in an unsafe context.

-   <https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/266897-general/topic/Rust.20uninit.20intrinsic/near/328521116>

As rust is designed to limit unitilized memory it would be great in the
future to look at this in more detail in the future for now we are
copying Rustc.
