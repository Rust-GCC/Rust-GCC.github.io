## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Milestone Progress

The focus for this month was the upstreaming of all `gccrs` commits
which affect common GCC parts, in order for our subsequent work to be
upstreamed properly. These patches are essential, as most of the work we
have done this year relies on them: Error codes, for example, require
changes to the error emitting framework within GCC. The procedural macro
work, which was the subject of Pierre-Emmanuel's internship, relies on
changes to the GCC build system in order for our set of Rust libraries
to be built when building the Rust frontend. We are almost done fixing
reviews from the GCC maintainers, and most of the commits aforementioned
have been pushed to GCC's `trunk` branch already. We will now continue
the upstreaming of commits, by sending over 800 patches to `trunk` in
the following weeks. This work needs to be completed before the end of
the GCC 14 development stage, which should happen sometime in May 2024.

The upstreaming of patches is however a time-consuming task, and coupled
with vacations, GNU Cauldron and the disappearance of our GSoC students,
only 35 pull-requests have been merged to the `gccrs` repository this
month. Nonetheless, we are on track and are happy with the progress of
the compiler. The technical work that has been merged this month focused
on compiler intrinsics, as well as backend cleanups. Furthermore, a
longstanding cross- compilation issue has been fixed, allowing some of
our early `gccrs` users to continue using the compiler for Dreamcast/SH4
development.

The main event this month for `gccrs` was GNU Cauldron, during which
Pierre-Emmanuel Patry gave an amazing talk detailing the progress of the
frontend as well as some technical details regarding procedural macros.
You can find the slides for this talk
[here](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/Reporting/blob/main/Cauldron%202023.pdf).
The next talk we will give will be at EuroRust 2023, in a couple of
weeks!

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 9th of October 2023.
You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be held.
The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to sit-in and
listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.
