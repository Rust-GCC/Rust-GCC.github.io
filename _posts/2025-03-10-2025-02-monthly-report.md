## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Project update

We are still working hard to get as many features completed in time
before the release of GCC 15.1. We have started preparing our branch for
upstreaming patches to the compiler, and are in the process of improving
our upstreaming and fork-updating process to make it more streamlined
and enable upstreams to happen more often. This is taking quite a bit of
time, but we are still on track regarding the milestones we set
ourselves for GCC 15.1

We have started work on two major technical features required for
handling Rust-for-Linux code: `impl Trait types` and `let-else`, two
patterns used in the kernel and also often found in user code. Note also
that `impl Trait types` are also used extensively in `core`, and are
thus a requirement for properly handling the Rust standard library.

We have also continued work on our ongoing milestones, such as macro
expansion fixes, our name resolution rewrite, and the handling of
conditional compilation directives for `core`. We will then start
working on a slimmed down version of
[specialization](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1210-impl-specialization.html),
as it is seldom used in `core`, but still required for properly
compiling it.

Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur will be attending Rust in Paris on the 14th
of March, and we are hoping to meet lots of other French Rustaceans. Our
next event will then be RustWeek in the Netherlands in May, and we will
also be attending EuroRust in Paris where we hope to give a talk on the
current state of `gccrs`.

A missing part of our macro expansion implementation was the handling of
the `$crate` metavar, a special meta-variable used in macros which
allows to refer to items defined in the same crate as the macro itself.
When such a macro is used in an external crate, the metavar needs to be
replaced by the crate-name and a scope resolution operator
(`::<crate_name>`), but when it is used in the current crate,
it can simply be replaced by the `crate` path segment.

In RfL's inner implementation of its printing macros, this is used for
making a call to a specific function: `call_printk`. This enables
calling the macro from the kernel as well as from any kernel modules
which uses the kernel as a dependency.

``` rust

macro_rules! print_macro (
  ($format_string:path, false, $($arg:tt)+) => (
      match format_args!($($arg)+) {
          args => unsafe {
              $crate::print::call_printk(
                  &$format_string,
                  crate::__LOG_PREFIX,
                  args,
              );
          }
      }
  );
);

```

Another feature we need to handle for Rust in the Linux kernel is
`let else` statements. `let else` statements look just like regular
`let` statements with a pattern, with an extra diverging `else` block in
case the pattern does not match. This example is taken directly from the
kernel's inner implementation for parsing some of its macros.

``` rust

let Some(TokenTree::Ident(ident)) = tokens.next() else {
  panic!("expected identifier as modifier");
};

```

Functionally, the above code is similar to this one:

``` rust

let ident = match tokens.next() {
  Some(TokenTree::Ident(ident)) => ident,
  _ => panic!("expected identifier as modifier"),
};

```

However, we cannot just desugar to a match expression despite the
behavior being the same. The reason for this is that the following code
typechecks:

``` rust

let foo = match bar() {
  Some(value) => value,
  None => default_value,
};

```

While this one does not:

``` rust

let Some(value) = bar() else {
  Some(default_value)
};

```

As the `else` block of a `let else` must be a diverging expression,
whose type can only be `!`. So, something like a `return` expression or
a macro invocation of `unreachable!()` or `panic!()`.

[Playground
example](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2024&gist=d60a434b58ebee9c4a05624907cdda19)

``` rust

let Some(TokenTree::Ident(ident)) = tokens.next() else {
  panic!("expected identifier as modifier");
};

```

Finally, we also started working on handling opaque types/~impl Trait
types~. This is required for many existing Rust programs and libraries,
as it is a feature often used for refering to unnameable types or for
more concise code. For example, when specifying complex bounds on a
generic type, one can often use an `impl Trait type` instead:

``` rust

fn foo<T: Iterator<Item = Bar>>(iterator: T) {}

// becomes

fn foo(iterator: impl Iterator<Item = Bar>) {}

```

More importantly, they are required for returning unnameable types, for
example in the case of closures. We know that closures implement
function-like traits, but they don't have a type that is defined
anywhere in source - their type is only known by the compiler. This
makes it extremely hard to return them, as one is not quite sure what to
put in their function's signature. We can use the `impl Trait` notation
to express the fact that what we are returning implements a certain
trait that we know about (in the case of closures, often `Fn`, `FnOnce`
or `FnMut`), and the typechecker will ensure that is the case.

``` rust

#[inline]
fn flatten<U: Iterator, Acc>(
  fold: &mut impl FnMut(Acc, U::Item) -> Acc,
) -> impl FnMut(Acc, U) -> Acc + '_ {
  move |acc, iter| iter.fold(acc, &mut *fold)
}

```

In the case of Rust-for-Linux, this is also used to abstract complex
memory operations used when dealing with self-referential types. The
kernel offers a helpful `pin_init!()` macro for initializing
self-referrential types, but the concrete type is not known by the user
and thus cannot be named - all the user needs to know about is that this
type implements the `PinInit` trait.

``` rust

impl Example {
  fn new() -> impl PinInit<Self> {
      pin_init!(Self {
          c: 10,
          d <- new_mutex!(Inner { a: 20, b: 30 }),
      })
  }
}

```

## Planned Activities

- Finish `derive(PartialOrd)` implementation
- Finish let-else implementation
- Start working on RfL related milestones
- Start working on specialization

### Risks

We have now entered Stage 3 of GCC development, and all of the patches
we needed to get upstreamed have been upstreamed. The risk that were
outlined here are no longer present, and we are focusing on getting as
many features implemented and upstreamed as possible.
