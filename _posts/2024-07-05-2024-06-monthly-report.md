## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Project update

All of our GSoC students are progressing nicely on their projects.
[Jasmine Tang](https://github.com/badumbatish) has worked her inline
assembly nodes through almost all of the passes of our pipeline, and is
now working on lowering them to GCC's inline assembly representation.
The `rustc` testsuite adapter tool, whose development is lead by
[Muhammad Mahad](https://github.com/MahadMuhammad), is starting to be
usable for converting `rusttest` testcases to the `dejagnu` format, and
we are expecting the integration of some `rustc` testcases to our
testsuite shortly. Finally, [Kushal Pal](https://github.com/braw-lee)'s
error reporting for borrow-checking errors is moving along nicely - we
are currently dealing with transmitting data between the Rust polonius
engine and our C++ compiler, which is a complex task with lots of edge
cases.

The milestones for `GCC` 14.2 and 15.1 are completed, and we are now
waiting on reviews for the patches sent upstream. We are hoping to get
our documentation-related patches merged in time for 14.2, and will get
in touch with the release managers to address this matter. In other
technical news, we have started working on the milestones related to
`for` loops handling and are making good progress. Work continues on the
name resolution rework, which we aim to complete in order to handle
`core` 1.49 properly.

Finally, `gccrs` will be attending two international Rust conferences
this year, with Arthur being present at RustConf and Pierre-Emmanuel
attending EuroRust. We are looking forward to meeting with the community
once again, and to talk about compilers for way too long :)

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 8th of July at 9am
UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be
held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to
sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

## Call for contribution

- [Issue 3001: Generic arguments are not disambiguated on error
  propagation
  expressions](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/3001)

Our error propagation expressions (expressions which use the question
mark operator, of the form `<expr>?`) are currently forgotten in many of
our AST visitors. As a result, there are unexpected cases when it comes
to various parts of the compiler pipeline handling them. In that
particular case, the function call's generic arguments are not
disambiguated - the compiler does not know if it needs to be handling a
generic type, or a const generic value. You will need to add handling to
our name resolution pass for these error propagation expressions. It
would be helpful to look at [the current generic
disambiguation](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/75049a3bfee8c3f888994bce3b741a805c631c2a/gcc/rust/resolve/rust-ast-resolve-type.cc#L568)
to start figuring out where it is called from, and where you need to
call it.

- [Issue 3045: Prevent `#[may_dangle]` attribute from being used in safe impl](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/3045)

The `#[may_dangle]` attribute is an important part of `core` 1.49, as it
is used in many `Drop` implementations of complex Rust standard types.
However, the usage of this attribute is complex, and has certain
consequences on the borrow-checker and drop-checker, two integral parts
of the Rust compiler pipeline. Because of this, its use is restricted to
`unsafe` trait implementations, which is a behavior we aim to reproduce
in `gccrs`. Have a look at our `UnsafeChecker` compiler pass to see what
you will need to modify. You can read about the `#[may_dangle]`
attribute [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/dropck.html).

- Continue work on name resolution and macro expansion for `core` 1.49
- Be proactive about 14.2 reviews
- Start adding Detailed Changelogs to the reports again
