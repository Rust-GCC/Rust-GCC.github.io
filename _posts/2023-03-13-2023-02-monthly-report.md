## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Milestone Progress

The number of contributions this month stayed extremely important, with
a lot of new contributors and many existing contributors returning. The
month of January, which was already impressive with around 50
pull-requests merged, got supplanted by February, where we saw around 80
pull-requests from more than a dozen people get submitted and merged!

We hope that everyone has a nice time contributing to the project, but
we are aware that there might still be some rough edges for new
contributors. Please feel free to reach out to let us know what could be
improved!

This month, Pierre-Emmanuel spent some more time getting our build
system to handle the new Rust libraries we will be bringing to the GCC
project. He has also made significant strides on multiple
`libcore`-related issues, namely on some features our parser lacked.
Philip has spent a lot of time on iterators and `for` loops, bringing us
closer and closer to supporting all of `libcore 1.49`'s intricacies and
internal mechanics. The handling of `for` loops requires being able to
compile a significant portion of `libcore`, which we are really excited
about. Arthur spent some more time on name resolution and macros
overall, finally bridging the gap between macro exporting and our
metadata exports, which allows us to start pulling in public macros from
external modules and crates.

Furthermore, the GCC project was accepted as a GSoC organization this
year again. We have put together 4 project proposals for `gccrs`, for
which you are welcome to submit a proposal! Philip and Arthur will be
mentoring applicants together.

You can find these project ideas [here on the GCC
wiki](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SummerOfCode), in the Rust frontend
section.

You will be able to start submitting them on the 20th of March. In the
meantime, feel free to come chat with us on
[Zulip](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) and discuss them, or talk about
new project ideas. We are open to all ideas, and are looking forward to
your submissions!

Finally, `gccrs` will be present at Embedded World 2023 at the Embecosm
booth. Feel free to come see us to chat about the project!

### Community call

We had our monthly community call on the 6th of March. You can subscribe
to our calendar to see when the next one will be held. The call is open
to everyone, even if you would just like to sit-in and listen. You can
also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

### Milestones Progress

We are putting together milestones regarding projects such as libproc
and will update the Milestone.

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not
representative: It shows a 69% completion rate, but does not take into
account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items. Thus the
percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done
divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall. Similarly, the
Update GCC's master branch milestone contains a [tracking
issue](https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/issues/1705) containing over
200 tasks. The percentage shown here takes this into account.

### Risks

The last remaining risk was for gccrs to not get merged in GCC 13 by us
missing the stage deadline, but that is no longer the case.

### Testing project

The testing project is on hold as we try and figure out some of the
issues we're running into with GitHub and our various automations around
it.

## Planned Activities

-   Finish patch upstreaming
-   Finish macro name resolution
-   libproc
-   Iterators and Bugs

## Detailed changelog

### Generic Argument bindings

Recently we add support for the binding associated types syntax in
generic arguments such as:

    core::ops::Add<Output = i32>>

This syntax of Output=xyz allows the arguments of an associated type
bound set the expected associated types expected argument to be. This
means when we do bounds checking we need to ensure that when bounds
match not only are they coherent as in are they actually implemented as
well as any parent trait bounds, but are their expected associated types
ok. So for example you might do something like this:

``` rust
mod core {
    mod ops {
        #[lang = "add"]
        pub trait Add<Rhs = Self> {
            type Output;

            fn add(self, rhs: Rhs) -> Self::Output;
        }
    }
}

impl core::ops::Add for f32 {
    type Output = f32;

    fn add(self, rhs: Self) -> Self::Output {
        self + rhs
    }
}

pub fn foo<T: core::ops::Add<Output = i32>>(a: T) -> i32 {
    a + a
}

pub fn main() {
    foo(123f32);
}
```

This test case shows that we expected foo to take an Add trait bound
with an output of i32 but in main we are passing an f32 which obviously
returns an f32 for its add output. Which results in this error:

    <source>:25:9: error: expected 'i32' got 'f32'
       13 |     type Output = f32;
          |     ~~~~ 
    ......
       20 | pub fn foo<T: core::ops::Add<Output = i32>>(a: T) -> i32 {
          |               ~~~~
    ......
