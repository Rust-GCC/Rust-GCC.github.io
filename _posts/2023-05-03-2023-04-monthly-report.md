## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Milestone Progress

GCC 13.1 is on track to be released this week, and you might be a little
surprised to see that `gccrs` will not be included in the release. This
was done for multiple reasons, which you can read about in the blogpost
we have published on the subject
[here](https://rust-gcc.github.io/2023/04/24/gccrs-and-gcc13-release.html).
The reasoning boils down to "`gccrs` is not yet ready, nor is it useful
for general users, and needs a little more time in the oven". If you are
still interested in trying out the compiler or hacking on it, we mention
the alternatives in the blogpost.

Many contributors have submitted PRs this month, with over 50
contributions and three new contributors once again. Thank you all! The
code submitted is extremely high quality, and fixes some very important
issues (and sometimes, long-standing ones!) which you can read about in
the various pull-requests linked below. We are also nearing the end of
the review period for this year's GSoC, meaning the results will be
announced shortly - we are looking forward to working with the chosen
students. Thank you again for your interest this year!

We are in the process of preparing a talk for [EuroRust
2023](https://eurorust.eu/), which we will be attending and where we
hope to speak. We are looking forward to meeting with all of you once
again!

Finally, we spent some time this month putting together new milestones
to better reflect the upcoming work on the compiler. You can find a list
of these milestones at the end of this report.

On the technical side of things, we are still progressing towards the
compilation of the core Rust library. Philip has spent a lot of time on
our type system once again, cleaning many HIR-related bugs which occured
with iterators as well as other complex Rust traits. Arthur has kept
working on the macro side of things, with more fixes regarding macro
imports, exports, as well as derive macros. [Pierre-Emmanuel
Patry](https://github.com/P-E-P) is doing some great work on our build
system and procedural macro library, and we hope to soon expand our
first user-defined macro!

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 15th of May 2023.
You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be held.
The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to sit-in and
listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

### Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not
representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into
account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items. Thus the
percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done
divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall. Similarly, the
Update GCC's master branch milestone contains a [tracking
issue](https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/issues/1705) containing over
200 tasks. The percentage shown here takes this into account.

### Testing project

The testing project is on hold as we try and figure out some of the
issues we're running into with GitHub and our various automations around
it.

## Planned Activities

-   Keep going on derive macros
-   Fix remaining type systems bugs for libcore 1.49
-   Start expanding custom procedural macros in our pipeline

## Detailed changelog

### Builtin derive macros

While [Pierre-Emmanuel Patry](https://github.com/P-E-P) is working on
support for custom procedural macros including \`derive\` macros, Arthur
is spending some time on the implementation of builtin `derive` macros -
there are only a handful of these macros (`Clone`, `Copy`, `Debug`,
`Default`, `Hash`, `{Partial}Eq` and `{Partial}Ord`) but they are used
very often in Rust code. The concept of deriving is well known to
functional programmers, and in Rust it allows users to implement simple
traits for their custom types without the extra boilerplate of creating
an `impl` block.

A simple example we have been working on is the following:

``` rust
pub trait Clone {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self;
}

pub trait Copy {}

impl Copy for i32 {}

impl<T> Clone for T
where
    T: Copy,
{
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        *self
    }
}

#[derive(Clone)]
struct S(i32, i32);

fn main() -> i32 {
    let a = S(15, 15);
    let b = a.clone();

    b.0 - b.1
}
```

Upon seeing the `#[derive(Clone)]` attribute, the compiler will generate
an `impl` block for the structure `S` allowing us to call the `clone`
method on it, as shown when initializing the `b` variable.

Here is a little comparison of the code generated by `rustc` and
`gccrs`:

`rustc` with `-Z unpretty=expanded`:

``` rust

#![feature(prelude_import)]
#![no_std]
#[prelude_import]
use ::std::prelude::v1::*;
#[macro_use]
extern crate std;
pub trait Clone {
    fn clone(&self)
    -> Self;
}

pub trait Copy { }

impl Copy for i32 { }

impl <T> Clone for T where T: Copy {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self { *self }
}

struct S(i32, i32);
#[automatically_derived]
#[allow(unused_qualifications)]
impl ::core::clone::Clone for S {
    #[inline]
    fn clone(&self) -> S {
        match *self {
            S(ref __self_0_0, ref __self_0_1) =>
            S(::core::clone::Clone::clone(&(*__self_0_0)),
              ::core::clone::Clone::clone(&(*__self_0_1))),
        }
    }
}

fn main() -> i32 {
    let a = S(15, 15);
    let b = a.clone();

    b.0 - b.1
}
```

and `gccrs` with `-frust-dump-all`:

``` rust
pub trait Clone{
    fn clone(&self) -> Self;

}

pub trait Copy{}

impl Copy for i32 {

}

impl Clone for T {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        *self /* tail expr */

    }


}

impl Clone for S {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        S(
            Clone::clone(
                &self.0,
            ),
            Clone::clone(
                &self.1,
            ),
        ) /* tail expr */

    }


}

struct S(i32, i32);

fn main() -> i32 {
    let a = S(
        15,
        15,
    );
    let b = ;
    b.0 - b.1 /* tail expr */

}
```

Since we are not yet able to link the `core` crate to the Rust projects
we compile, we are not calling into `::core::clone::Clone::clone` like
`rustc` does - this is something that will be fixed as soon as we link
against the `core` crate.

We still have a lot of work to do, especially regarding the handling of
more complex builtin derive macros such as `PartialOrd`. Our future work
will also include enhancing the user experience with these macros, as
some "derive-specific" errors need to be emitted in order to not confuse
users.
