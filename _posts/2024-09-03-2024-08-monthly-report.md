## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Project update

This month saw really good progress in terms of the number of merged
PRs, issues completed, and testcases added. All three Google Summer of
Code projects got completed, which required extensive reviewing. Our
three students passed the final evaluation brillantly, and are all
interested in continuing to contribute to the compiler in their free
time. We are very happy to have them join the team, and are looking
forward to their future work. We have offered to help mentor them in the
future, as well as to help with any compiler-related studies they might
have. As a reminder, anyone interested in contributing to the project
will be able to receive similar help and mentoring.

In fact, we are currently working with another student outside of GSoC
to put together a testsuite and testing program which will help us
assert that `gccrs` produces code with correct semantics (as a reminder,
correct means "with `rustc`'s semantics"). It is important for `gccrs`
to only accept the correct subset of code, but it is also necessary that
the assembly we produce has the same meaning and the same runtime
characteristics as any other Rust program. This ties into our pursuit of
producing a "correct" compiler, which we'll talk about more in a future
blogpost in cooperation with the Rust project.

In terms of technical contributions, we have closed the
`Unhandled attributes` milestone, which covered the handling of all
attributes required for compiling `core 1.49`. We have made good
progress on the `Lang items` milestone, with the only remaining step
being to switch our existing code generation of lang item paths to these
new paths we introduced. This will help all of our early code generation
pipeline, namely surrounding built-in macros and the desugaring of
certain constructs like `for` loops. Once this is done, we will fix the
issues surrounding iterators and indexing, which currently prevent `for`
loops from being completely implemented. We have gained a few new
contributors this summer, and we hope that this trend continues. We hope
they continue to contribute to the project, and will spend some time
this week to try and help with the codebase when necessary. For a look
at the work we plan on doing this year, check out [the engineering
document we established a few months
ago](https://rust-gcc.github.io/2024/09/03/towards-gcc15.1.html).

Finally, we would like to be more public about `gccrs`'s progress. In
some recent comments surrounding the Rust-for-Linux project, we have
noted that some internauts believe that the work on the compiler has
slowed down, despite our regular upstreaming and progress reports. We
think this might be due to a lack of activity on social media and forums
such as Reddit or HackerNews, and will start posting our monthly updates
there again. We will also be coming out with a few blogposts in the
coming weeks, namely around the progress achieved by our GSoC students
and how it will impact users.

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 16th of September at
9am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will
be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to
sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

## Call for contribution

-   [Issue 3001: Generic arguments are not disambiguated on error
    propagation
    expressions](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/3001)

Our error propagation expressions (expressions which use the question
mark operator, of the form `<expr>?`) are currently forgotten in many of
our AST visitors. As a result, there are unexpected cases when it comes
to various parts of the compiler pipeline handling them. In that
particular case, the function call's generic arguments are not
disambiguated - the compiler does not know if it needs to be handling a
generic type, or a const generic value. You will need to add handling to
our name resolution pass for these error propagation expressions. It
would be helpful to look at [the current generic
disambiguation](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/75049a3bfee8c3f888994bce3b741a805c631c2a/gcc/rust/resolve/rust-ast-resolve-type.cc#L568)
to start figuring out where it is called from, and where you need to
call it.
