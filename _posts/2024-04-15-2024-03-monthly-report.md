## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Project update

This month saw another influx of new contributors as the start of GSoC
approaches. This year looks to be very promising, with a lot of
proposals received for the GCC project as a whole, and a lot of them
being dedicated specifically to gccrs. 21 proposals were sent to the
organization, which is similar to last year with 23 proposals. In the
same vein, `gccrs` proposals totaled 7 submissions, compared to 8 last
year.

The proposals we've read so far are of high quality and very well
written. Our three mentors, Philip, Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur, are
reviewing them and will choose applicants in the next week or so.

The major news this month is the fast approaching release of GCC 14.1.
We are hard at work, trying to fix as many bugs as possible and add as
many features as we can before that deadline. We are excited for you to
be able to try them out, and are looking forward to the numerous bug
reports. As a reminder, `gccrs` will not be suitable for real use cases
in its first release yet, and will still require you to pass additional
options to ensure you understand the risks of using such an experimental
compiler. We are thankful for all of the folks who will try our project
out.

We have made last minutes changes to GCC's build system in order to
improve the situation with our new dependency on Rust - the project will
now error out early if you do not have Rust installed, so as to prevent
this error happening down the line after 75% of the compilation of the
project is done. This patch is currently being reviewed and will be
upstreamed soon. After this, we will resume upstreaming the technical
contributions we've made in the past two weeks or so.

These contributions concern the expansion of `format_args!()` macro
invocations, as well as the expansion of `for`-loops, both necessary for
the `println!()` macro to be implemented. Pierre-Emmanuel has also made
great progress on our name resolution rewrite in order to support glob
imports, which were previously unhandled in the project. Finally, Jakub
Dupak made further progress on the borrow checker, emitting more facts
for the `polonius-engine` library and thus adding more and more
infrastructure for more and more borrow-checking static analysis.

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 15th of April at
10am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one
will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like
to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.
