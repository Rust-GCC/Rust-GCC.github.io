## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Project update

37 pull-requests were merged this month, which makes October one of the
most productive months of this year for `gccrs`. Most of the changes
concerned our name resolution rewrite, and more specifically its
integration to the rest of the compiler pipeline. This paves the way for
the removal of our old name resolution algorithm, which will happen as
soon as all testcases pass using the new algorithm. Some long standing
type system bugs were also fixed, which brings us closer and closer
towards typechecking `core` and being able to compile it. We are now
approaching the end of the Stage 1 period for GCC 15.1, which means we
will soon no longer be able to push changes to common GCC
infrastructure. As such, we are spending some time making sure all of
these changes are properly sent upstream and are being reviewed. Changes
made specifically to the Rust frontend will be upstreamable until the
release of GCC 15.1, in spring of 2025. We are also working towards a
rework of our fork-updating process, in order to make it easier to
develop `gccrs` on the most recent version of GCC. This process is
currently manual, and hard to automate - which is not fair to the
contributor in charge of this task. Spending this time will make it
easier for us to upstream our changes, which will speed up that process.

The technical blogpost from last month was well-received, with positive
comments and conversations on Reddit. It has been linked in the
blog.rust-lang.org blogpost, which has been reviewed and approved, and
should release shortly.

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 12th of November at
10am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one
will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like
to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

## Call for contribution

There are no calls for contribution this month, as we do not have a lot
of good first issues available. Still, feel free to take a look at them
[here](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-pr)
and get in touch with us for some mentoring or help!
