## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Project update

We are continuing our work towards GCC 15.1, and trying to develop as
many features as possible before this release. The only non-technical
news this month is our Talk submission to RustWeek in the Netherlands,
which you can find
[here](https://www.papercall.io/speakers/134949/speaker_talks/287270-inching-ever-closer-to-the-rust-standard-library-with-gccrs) -
Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur are looking forward to meeting all of you
there!

We are happy to report that this month saw an impressive 48
pull-requests merged, with contributions from 10 individual developers
including two new contributors, [Lishin](https://github.com/Lishin1215)
and [Dylan Gardner](https://github.com/dylngg).

Similarly to last month, we have been focusing on a few select
milestones which affect a large amount of code within the Rust standard
library and the Rust-for-Linux project.

We have completed the work on for-loops, and have started working on
adding support for the famous ["Question Mark
operator"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std/result/question_mark.html).
These two milestones required an important rework of both our AST and
HIR path classes, which affect almost all classes in the compiler. This
rework also allowed us to continue working on Rust's built-in derive
macros, in particular `Clone`, `Copy`, `Default`, `PartialEq` and `Eq`.

While for-loops are simple constructs in most programming languages,
they pose a real challenge in Rust and require a lot of features to be
implemented properly - iterators, lang-item, type inference… After weeks
of work, they are finally complete and available in `gccrs`. They are
used in multiple areas of both the Rust standard library and
Rust-for-Linux, which means our compiler's reach has greatly increased
by supporting this seemingly simple feature. If you are interested, have
a look at our documentation for their implementation which goes into
more detail:
[rust-desugar-for-loops.h](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/ea2be9c594daadb8bc63133253aef4f7db208a26/gcc/rust/ast/rust-desugar-for-loops.h#L29)

Our implementation of the Question Mark operator is almost complete,
with only a couple of type inference issues remaining to close out the
milestone. They are currently being worked on and will soon be merged
into the compiler.

Our work on built-in derive macros also affects a large area of
Rust-for-Linux and `core` code, as these macros are used for an
important number of primitive Rust types. We added support for two new
important derive macros this month, `Default` and `PartialEq`. `Default`
enables the user to generate a `::default()` function, which will create
a basic instance of a type with all of its fields using a default value.
This is for example used in Rust-for-Linux's `ModuleInfo` struct, which
is used whenever you define a new Rust module for the kernel:

``` rust
#[derive(Debug, Default)] // <-- HERE!
struct ModuleInfo {
    type_: String,
    license: String,
    name: String,
    author: Option<String>,
    description: Option<String>,
    alias: Option<Vec<String>>,
    firmware: Option<Vec<String>>,
}

impl ModuleInfo {
    fn parse(it: &mut token_stream::IntoIter) -> Self {
        let mut info = ModuleInfo::default(); // <-- generated function is used HERE!

```

(from
<https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/rust-next/rust/macros/module.rs#L92>)

Fully supporting the `ModuleInfo` type means compiling its
implementation, which requires us to offer a proper `::default()`
function for the type - which in itself requires supporting
`#[derive(Default)]` for all of the types and subtypes contained within
the `ModuleInfo` structure: `String`, `Option<T>`, `Vec<T>`…

Another example of built-in derive macro in Rust-for-Linux is
`PartialEq`, which can be found in the implementation of the [kernel
memory allocation infrastructure
interface](https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/rust-next/rust/kernel/alloc.rs).
The implementiaton of the `PartialEq` trait through that macro enables
the comparison of these allocation flags, which is required for `gccrs`
to properly compile the Rust elements of the kernel.

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 17th of February at
10am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one
will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like
to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

## Planned Activities

-   Implement remaining built-in derive macros
-   Improve our process for updating our github repository with upstream
    GCC

### Risks

We have now entered Stage 3 of GCC development, and all of the patches
we needed to get upstreamed have been upstreamed. The risk that were
outlined here are no longer present, and we are focusing on getting as
many features implemented and upstreamed as possible.
