## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Project update

74 pull-requests were merged this month, with multiple internal compiler
error fixes thanks to the fuzzing work done by [Matthias
Kr√ºger](https://github.com/matthiaskrgr), which helped expose multiple
invalid code paths in the compiler. Thank you!

We also spent some time getting our mininum supported Rust version down
to Rust 1.49 for our Rust components. As a reminder, Rust 1.49 is the
version that `gccrs` currently targets, and getting our own Rust
components compilable with this version also means getting closer and
closer to `gccrs` compiling its own components - an objective we will
pursue as soon as we are able to compile the Rust standard library. This
also enables for more testing on less common systems, as certain
versions of Darwin or Ubuntu still in use by our community only have
access to older Rust installations.

We are still working on developing new features and upstreaming them in
time for the GCC 15.1 release. The cutoff date for the branch is yet to
be announced, but should happen soon. We have continued work on our
milestones, and have spent a lot of time getting further and further
into the compilation of `core`. This opened new issues on the project
with our macro expansion and name resolution, which we quickly fixed in
the last few weeks.

One of the focus of this month was adding support for the
`min_specialization` feature, which you can learn more about
[here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1210-impl-specialization.md).
In its current form, `gccrs` only supports a subset of
`min_specialization`, which itself is a subset of `specialization` in
general. We are required to support parts of this feature as it used in
`core` to improve runtime performance in certain cases.

For example, the machinery responsible for implementing
[`Iterator::zip`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.zip)
(as a reminder, `Iterator::zip` enables you to tie together two
iterators and advance them as the same time) lives in the
`core::iter::adapters::ZipImpl` trait, whose definition looks like this:

``` rust

// Zip specialization trait
#[doc(hidden)]
trait ZipImpl<A, B> {
    type Item;
    fn new(a: A, b: B) -> Self;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
    fn size_hint(&self) -> (usize, Option<usize>);
    fn nth(&mut self, n: usize) -> Option<Self::Item>;
    fn next_back(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>
    where
        A: DoubleEndedIterator + ExactSizeIterator,
        B: DoubleEndedIterator + ExactSizeIterator;
    // This has the same safety requirements as `Iterator::__iterator_get_unchecked`
    unsafe fn get_unchecked(&mut self, idx: usize) -> <Self as Iterator>::Item
    where
        Self: Iterator + TrustedRandomAccess;
}
```

If we keep reading through the file, we can see two implementations for
this trait:

``` rust

impl<A, B> ZipImpl<A, B> for Zip<A, B>
where
    A: Iterator,
    B: Iterator,
{ /* ... */ }

// and ...

#[doc(hidden)]
impl<A, B> ZipImpl<A, B> for Zip<A, B>
where
    A: TrustedRandomAccess + Iterator,
    B: TrustedRandomAccess + Iterator,
{ /* ... */ }
```

In one case, the implementation is more specialized and adds an extra
bound - `TrustedRandomAccess`. Without specialization, these two
implementations are ambiguous, as they contain similar bounds. But by
using specialization, the `core` library is able to provide a default,
safe and slower implementation of `zip` while also providing a fast one
where possible, for example if the iterators support trusted random
access, meaning it supports efficent and safe random index accesses.

The method `next` for these two implementations of `ZipImpl` thus look
like the following:

``` rust

impl<A, B> ZipImpl<A, B> for Zip<A, B>
where
    A: Iterator,
    B: Iterator,
{
    #[inline]
    default fn next(&mut self) -> Option<(A::Item, B::Item)> {
        let x = self.a.next()?;
        let y = self.b.next()?;
        Some((x, y))
    }
}

// and...

impl<A, B> ZipImpl<A, B> for Zip<A, B>
where
    A: TrustedRandomAccess + Iterator,
    B: TrustedRandomAccess + Iterator,
{
    #[inline]
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<(A::Item, B::Item)> {
        if self.index < self.len {
            let i = self.index;
            self.index += 1;
            // SAFETY: `i` is smaller than `self.len`, thus smaller than `self.a.len()` and `self.b.len()`
            unsafe {
                Some((self.a.__iterator_get_unchecked(i), self.b.__iterator_get_unchecked(i)))
            }
        } else if A::may_have_side_effect() && self.index < self.a.size() {
            // match the base implementation's potential side effects
            // SAFETY: we just checked that `self.index` < `self.a.len()`
            unsafe {
                self.a.__iterator_get_unchecked(self.index);
            }
            self.index += 1;
            None
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}
```

In the more specific method, the behavior is the same, but the
implementation makes use of extra type information to provide faster
runtime performance when selecting the next items to iterate on. With
the work done this month, `gccrs` is now able to select these faster
methods without producing an "ambiguous method resolution" error. While
specialization is not used in Rust-for-Linux, it is important that we
are able to resolve to the same methods as `rustc` when compiling code.
This will also make for more optimized binaries and a faster kernel once
we are able to compile Rust-for-Linux. In order to fully support
`min_specialization` however, we would need to implement a new algorithm
for deciding between two `default` functions and choosing the most
specific one, which would require the development of a new decision tree
and the associated algorithms. This is not required for `core` or
Rust-for-Linux, and will thus be worked on at a later date.

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 22nd of April at 9am

## Planned Activities

-   Finish `derive(PartialOrd)` and `derive(PartialEq)` implementation
-   Finish let-else compilation
-   Upstream changes up to the release point

### Risks

We have now entered Stage 3 of GCC development, and all of the patches
we needed to get upstreamed have been upstreamed. The risk that were
outlined here are no longer present, and we are focusing on getting as
many features implemented and upstreamed as possible.
