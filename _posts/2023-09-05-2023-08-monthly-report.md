## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Milestone Progress

Another very important month in terms of contributions, with 86 pull
requests merged. Once again, most of them come from the Google Summer of
Code program, which is coming to an end. You can expect more detailed
blogposts about our students' work this summer in the coming weeks, but
the short of it is: they have both been hugely successful, and have
proved to be amazing contributors to the project. They have both passed
the GSoC evaluations brillantly, and we are hoping they will keep
working on the project! Thank you [Raiki
Tamura](https://github.com/tamaroning) and [Mahad
Muhammad](https://github.com/mahadmuhammad)! Well done!

On the technical side of things, late name resolution is going
swimmingly. We are now in the process of merging it in the compiler,
while still keeping it hidden behind a specific command line flag
(`-frust-name-resolution-2.0`). A lot of our existing testsuite passes
with that new option enabled, and we are working on fixing the remaining
failures. Pierre- Emmanuel has done some really good work on our early
name resolution too, taking care of transforming it into a fixed point
algorithm which runs until nothing has changed. This enables interesting
behaviors, such as a macro invocation expanding to a macro definition,
which a later invocation could resolve to. Early name resolution is also
responsible for handling imports (`use` declarations), and we are on
track to add the last piece of the puzzle needed for resolving **all**
`core` 1.49 imports: glob imports (`use foo::*`). These imports work
differently from regular imports, as they only concern public items, and
can be shadowed by later declarations, but they are much easier to
handle in our new name resolution algorithm and are almost there.

This resolution pass also needs to tie in with the rest of the codebase,
namely typechecking and our compilation backend, which rely on it
closely. We have spent a long amount of time recreating the missing
functions from those new data structures, and making sure the later
compilation passes could make use of the new resolution.

On the typechecking side, Philip is also getting infuriatingly close to
getting iterators working! Thanks to advice from
[bjorn3](https://github.com/bjorn3/) and [Matthew
Jasper](https://github.com/matthewjasper), we have identified a few bugs
in our handling of compiler intrinsics, which are now fixed. The
handling of opaque types is one of the last big pieces of iterator
support, which Philip is currently working on.

After that work is complete, we will start working on the
`format_args!()` builtin macro, a central component of the widely used
`println!()` macro as well as a lot of print-like macros available in
Linux kernel.

``` rust
macro_rules! print_macro (
    // The non-continuation cases (most of them, e.g. `INFO`).
    ($format_string:path, false, $($arg:tt)+) => (
        // SAFETY: This hidden macro should only be called by the documented
        // printing macros which ensure the format string is one of the fixed
        // ones. All `__LOG_PREFIX`s are null-terminated as they are generated
        // by the `module!` proc macro or fixed values defined in a kernel
        // crate.
        unsafe {
            $crate::print::call_printk(
                &$format_string,
                crate::__LOG_PREFIX,
                format_args!($($arg)+),
            );
        }
    );

    // The `CONT` case.
    ($format_string:path, true, $($arg:tt)+) => (
        $crate::print::call_printk_cont(
            format_args!($($arg)+),
        );
    );
);
```

Finally, we are looking forward to meeting with the GCC community once
again during GNU Cauldron at the end of September in Cambridge. Philip
and Pierre-Emmanuel will be giving a talk about some of the recent
changes in the compiler, as well as the inner workings of procedural
macros. We will also be talking about the compilation of the `core`
library at EuroRust in Brussels. See you then!

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 11th of September
2023. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be
held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to
sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.
