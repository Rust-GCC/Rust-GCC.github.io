## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Milestone Progress

This month, work has started on `format_args!()`, one of the last pieces
of the puzzle for the feature wishlist of GCC 14.1. As a reminder, once
that compiler macro will be implemented, you will have access to macros
such as `println!` and `format!` in `gccrs`, thus enabling you to
finally run one of the most complex Rust programs out there:

``` rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!")
}
```

In other technical compiler frontend news, Pierre-Emmanuel worked hard
this month to make our parser **more** permissive, by allowing more
"invalid" Rust constructs to be parsed and then later rejected during a
new AST validation pass. The `rustc` testsuite expects to parse some of
these invalid constructs, such as "unsafe modules" or "const trait
functions" - which could be useful for later features of the language.
For example, "async trait functions" were rejected until recently - but
they are now being integrated to stable Rust. It makes sense then that
our parser allows such constructs, but rejects them later on once we
know more about the current Rust edition we are targeting, and which
unstable features we've enabled. Further in the compiler pipeline,
[Raiki Tamura](https://github.com/tamaroning), one of our 2023 GSoC
student is continuing to work on v0 name mangling - an important backend
feature for the compilation of the Rust-for-Linux project.

More work is being done on the borrow-checker by [Jakub
Dupak](https://github.com/jdupak), who had to fight various parts of our
type checker in order to propagate lifetime information all the way to
his compiler pass. While this does not add any new borrow checking
errors, it is very important that all that information is being used
properly in order to keep going with the borrow-checking feature.

Finally, Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur are finalizing the FOSDEM talks that
they will be submitting, and work on a joint blogpost with the Rust
project has started again - which we will share here once we are more
advanced.

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 11th of December
2023. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be
held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to
sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

## Call for contribution

This is a new section for particularly easy or interesting issues we
would like folks external to the project to contribute to. We are
available for mentoring and guiding you on their resolution. This is a
great way to start making your mark on a complex project such as this
one and to learn a lot in the process!
