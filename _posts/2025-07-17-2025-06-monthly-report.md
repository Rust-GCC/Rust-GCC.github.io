## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Project update

The month of June saw a good number of contributions to the project,
with 61 pull-requests merged - despite Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur both
being on vacation for two weeks each. One of the most important
milestones this month was the merge of our name-resolution 2.0
algorithm, and the removal of the previous version. This merge marks the
end of a year and a half of work aimed at better handling the complex
import and export structure in \`core\`, while remaining as powerful as
the existing solution.

Another major breakthrough is the completion of our git process rework -
thanks to the work of Marc Poulhies, Thomas Schwinge and Owen Avery, we
have considerably improved our processes for updating our fork and
upstreaming changes. Work on `gerris` has resumed, with more features
being added to the bot. This should enable us to prepare branches
automatically, test them on our CI, and have them ready for verification
by one of our maintainers before sending the commits upstream to GCC.
Similarly, `gerris` will soon be able to update our fork with the latest
changes from upstream GCC and will do so regularly.

We have also established further milestones for the next few months of
work on `gccrs`, as we get closer and closer to experimenting with the
kernel's `alloc` crate. We have discovered more interesting nightly
features being used by the crate, which we will implement in the coming
months.

1.  try blocks

    `try` blocks are used throughout `core`, especially in the
    implementation of the various iterators such as `try_fold`:

    ``` rust
    fn try_fold<B, F, R>(&mut self, init: B, mut f: F) -> R
    where
        Self: Sized,
        F: FnMut(B, Self::Item) -> R,
        R: Try<Ok = B>,
    {
        let mut accum = init;
        while let Some(x) = self.next() {
            accum = f(accum, x)?;
        }

        try { accum } // HERE
    }
    ```

    `try` blocks create a scope in which it is possible to use the `?`
    operator. They are syntactic sugar for the following construct:

    ``` rust
    try {
      <stmts>;
      <expr>
    }

    // becomes

    {
      <stmts>;
      ::std::ops::Try::from_ok(<expr>)
    }
    ```

    Handling them in the majority of cases should hopefully be a simple
    desugar that can be implemented quite quickly.

2.  const-generic inference

    Const-generic inference allows the user to instruct the compiler to
    deduct the value of a const generic instead of spelling it out
    explicitly. This is used in the `stdarch` crate, which `core`
    depends on, for the `simd_shuffle` macro, which takes as argument an
    array of unknown but fixed size:

    ``` rust
    macro_rules! simd_shuffle {
        ($x:expr, $y:expr, $idx:expr $(,)?) => {
            simd_shuffle(
                $x,
                $y,
                const {
                    let v: [u32; _] = $idx;
                    v
                },
            )
        };
    }

    let d: uint8x8_t = simd_shuffle!(b, b, [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]);

    let e: uint16x4_t = simd_shuffle!(c, c, [4, 5, 6, 7]);
    ```

    Since the array's size is known by the compiler, but not by the user
    writing the macro, we can rely on the compiler to infer the array's
    size and call the proper intrinsic, while still keeping the macro
    definition and invocations simple.

    In other news, our two GSoC students [Zhi
    Heng](https://github.com/polygonalr) and [Ryutaro
    Okada](https://github.com/sakupan102) are progressing nicely on
    their projects, with both students passing the upcoming midterm
    evaluation with flying colors. We are very satisfied with the speed
    at which they are working, as well as their comprehension of the
    task at hand. Ryutaro was able to reimplement one of our checks for
    assignments to read-only variables, and can now support generic
    functions, which was not allowed before. In the meantime, Zhi Heng
    has contributed multiple improvements to our backend regarding the
    compilation of complicated patterns such as tuple patterns and slice
    patterns.

    Finally, we are also in the process of merging fixes for the release
    of GCC 15.2.

## Planned Activities

-   Start working on try blocks and while-let loops
-   Finish name resolution and macro expansion issues

### Risks

We must establish the list of GCC-common changes we need, as we will
have to send them upstream before the start of Stage 3 around November.
This is the only risk which could incur further problems and prevent
more gccrs features from landing in 16.1.
