## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Project update

The month of August was focused on bug fixing for building `core`, once
again. We identified some issues in our macro expansion and reworked our
`ExpandVisitor`, a piece of code we had originally written 3 years ago
which contained some shortcomings and would not expand macro invocations
in all places required. We implemented a new visitor to visit nodes from
their container, and potentially reseat their pointer - which fixed a
lot of the issues and increased the completeness of the compiler. We
then transformed all of our mutating visitors into visitors inheriting
from this container visitor, which resulted in a cleaner codebase and a
more correct front end.

Google Summer of Code also came to an end, with both our students
[Ryutaro Okada](https://github.com/sakupan102) and [Zhi
Heng](https://github.com/Polygonalr) successfully completing their
projects and earning top scores in their final evaluations. It was a joy
to work alongside them on their projects, and we hope to see them
contribute in the future.

As a reminder, our current objective is to get `gccrs` to a state where
it can compile the Linux kernel's Rust parts. The Rust-for-Linux project
does not depend on the entire Rust standard library (`std`), but only on
`core` - like a lot of Rust embedded projects. However, because the
project wants to benefit from all of Rust's functionalities, they are
reimplementing parts of the standard library using the kernel's memory
allocator - this enables Rust kernel module developers to use types such
as `Vec<T>`, or `String`. As such, the milestones we worked on this
summer are aimed at two objectives:

1.  Compile Rust's `core` library, as it is the sole dependency of the
    Linux kernel's Rust crate
2.  Compile the Rust kernel crate

In order to do this, we had to implement some new Rust features over the
summer: namely, `try` blocks and `while-let` loops, both used in `core`
and within the kernel. The kernel makes use of more recent Rust features
that are not present in the version we target, so we must implement them
as well - for example, the `offset_of` macro.

Our first objective is the kernel's `alloc` crate, a reimplementation of
parts of the Rust `std` crate responsible for implementing dynamically
allocated types. Thanks to the work of our contributors over the summer,
we were able to implement all of the required language features
mentioned above. We are now debugging a few remaining bugs in our name
resolution and macro expansion passes.

The next two weeks of work on the project will be focused on these bugs,
and the last two weeks of the month of September will be solely
dedicated to compiling the Linux kernel's `alloc` crate.

We are currently interviewing two interns who would contribute to the
project for the period of September to January - we are currently
designing milestones for them, so that they may contribute meaningfully
to the project while gaining work experience within our company Embecosm
SAS.

Finally, we will also be present at three major conferences in
September:

-   Oxidize in Berlin, Germany
-   Kangrejos in Oviedo, Spain
-   GNU Cauldron in Port, Portugal

Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur will be giving talks at these three venues
and we hope to meet with everyone interested in the project!

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 8th of September at
9am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will
be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to
sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.
