## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Milestone Progress

We finally upstreamed our 2023 patchset to the GCC repository after long
weeks of checking, testing, amending and rebasing. We ended up pushing
879 commits to the repository, which will be included in the next GCC
14.1 release. We are now working towards upstreaming commits weekly, and
writing tooling to help us achieve that. We have already upstreamed 91
new commits which were submitted since the last upstream cutoff.

The entire team also went to FOSDEM, with Pierre-Emmanuel giving a talk
on the future of the project and our plans of integrating some `rustc`
components to the project. We will link the video of this talk once it
is available online. As a reminder, the first of these components being
integrated are the `polonius` borrow-checker and the format string
parser responsible for parsing `format_args!()` macro invocations. We
have posted a Request for Comments on the GCC mailing list, which
received positive answers:

<https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc/2024-January/243211.html>

We are also preparing subjects for this year's Google Summer of Code.
They will be published on the GCC wiki, and you are encouraged to come
discuss them with us on our Zulip chat. Feel free to also approach us
with an original idea, as we would love to mentor you on your own
addition to gccrs!

We would like to remind our readers that Jakub Dupak, one of our
contributors working on integrating the `polonius` borrow-checker to
gccrs, is currently finishing studying for his Master's Degree and is
looking for sponsorship to continue his work on the borrow checker.
Please get in touch if you or your company would be interested in
funding his work!

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 12th of February at
10am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one
will be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like
to sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

## Call for contribution

This is a new section for particularly easy or interesting issues we
would like folks external to the project to contribute to. We are
available for mentoring and guiding you on their resolution. This is a
great way to start making your mark on a complex project such as this
one and to learn a lot in the process!

-   [Issue 2819](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/2819)

This issue concerns adding better hints and errors around the order of
keywords for function qualifiers. This work allows you to get to grips
with our parser, as well as explore our error emitting machinery and add
better hints for future gccrs users.

Check out our [Contributing
guidelines](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to get started on them or feel free to send us a message on Zulip or
IRC!
