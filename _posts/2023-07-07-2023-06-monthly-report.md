## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Milestone Progress

The number of contributions increased this month with over 50 pull
requests merged in [`gccrs`](https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs) from
eight contributors and a couple more in our various tooling projects, as
well as valuable input on our different platforms, which remains a
tremendous help in the development of this compiler. Our two Google
Summer of Code students, [Mahad
Muhammad](https://github.com/MahadMuhammad) and [Raiki
Tamura](https://github.com/tamaroning), are progressing quickly on their
projects and submitting high quality contributions - we are getting more
and more of Rust's error codes integrated to our compiler, which will
assist us in trying to pass the `rustc` testsuite, and our lexer is
slowly but surely becoming Unicode compliant with a high number of unit
tests to boot. Their mid-term evaluations will start next week, and we
are excited to enter the second phase of their projects, where more
technical contributions will come in: v0 name mangling and punycode
support for [Raiki Tamura](https://github.com/tamaroning), and internal
GCC cleanups for the error emitting code for [Mahad
Muhammad](https://github.com/MahadMuhammad).

One unforeseen hurdle this month was the need for a complete rework of
our name resolution pass. Name resolution in Rust is a complex process,
which should be divided in two passes. In `gccrs`, name resolution was
developed before macro expansion, meaning that macro name resolution was
not taken into account properly. This is now starting to cause issues as
we try and fix the last few remaining bugs around imports, macro exports
and early name resolution in general for the compilation of `core` 1.49.
We have spent a lot of time trying to improve the existing name
resolution algorithms to stry and split them in two (or more) distinct
passes, but this is proving to be a difficult task. Furthermore, it is
an area of the compiler which deserves a little more attention, and has
not been improved much since its creation. Philip and Arthur took the
decision to rewrite this pass of the compiler, aiming for simpler data
structures, simpler algorithms and less global state, making the name
resolution pass a three-pass process: `TopLevel` name resolution,
`Early` name resolution and `Late` name resolution. The `TopLevel` pass
is in charge of collecting definitions for the entire program, as Rust
allows you to call a function defined later in the source. `Early` takes
care of macro name resolution and imports, and works in a fixed point
fashion with `TopLevel`. Finally, `Late` is your "classical" name
resolution pass, and resolves functions, types and variables.

We are mostly done with the data structures and are in the process of
merging them to our compiler. We now need to write the missing visitors
and name resolution 2.0 will be complete.

In our typesystem, Philip spent a lot of time chasing some of the few
remaining bugs needed for handling iterators. Most of the fixes are now
one-line fixes, which is quite disheartening, but also an indication
that we are getting closer and closer!

We are also in the process of welcoming [Jakub
Dupak](https://github.com/jdupak)'s Master thesis project, which will be
focused on adding support for the Polonius borrow checker to `gccrs`.
This exciting work should start in the upcoming months.

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 10th of July 2023.
You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be held.
The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to sit-in and
listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join

### Milestones Progress

Note that the intrinsics milestone percentage on github is not
representative: It shows a 73% completion rate, but does not take into
account the tracking issues with dozens of unresolved items. Thus the
percentage is computed using the sum of issues and tracked items done
divided by the sums of issues and tracked items overall. Similarly, the
Update GCC's master branch milestone contains a [tracking
issue](https://github.com/rust-gcc/gccrs/issues/1705) containing over
200 tasks. The percentage shown here takes this into account.

it.

## Planned Activities

-   Name resolution v2.0
-   Fix remaining type systems bugs for `core` 1.49
