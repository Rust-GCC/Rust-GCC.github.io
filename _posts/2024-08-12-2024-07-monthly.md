## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Project update

The progress done by students this month has been amazing, with multiple
improvements on all projects. The tool developed by [Muhammad
Mahad](https://github.com/MahadMuhammad) to adapt `rustc` testcases into
`gccrs` ones is almost ready, and will soon be used to import the entire
`rustc` testsuite to our project. [Jasmine
Tang](https://github.com/badumbatish) has made great progress on
compiling her inline assembly nodes, and is now figuring out the last
few details in order to support all of the inline assembly concepts used
by GCC. Finally, [Kushal Pal](https://github.com/braw-lee) has been
adding location information throughout the entire borrow-checking pass
of the compiler, and we are now able to emit proper errors with nice
hints for users to benefit from.

We are also joined by two new contributors this month, both spending a
lot of time on some long-standing compiler issues and producing good
quality work. Thank you both :)

Our 14.2 patches have not been reviewed, and thus did not make it into
the 14.2 release. This is not important, as the patches only concerned
documentation changes. Instead, we will be able to upstream these
patches without prior reviewing from the GCC maintainers in time for the
15.1 release, as they only concern the Rust frontend files. Regarding
our 15.1 milestones, we are currently tackling name resolution issues as
well as solving the issue of [`lang_items`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/language-features/lang-items.html),
which have been a long-standing pain point in the compiler. They are
supported in all of their facets, except when used for code generation,
which has to do with how `gccrs` handles paths in general. Fixing this
will make it easier for us to properly desugar `for`-loops, as well as a
few other language constructs.

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 12th of August at
9am UTC. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will
be held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to
sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.

## Call for contribution

- [Issue 3001: Generic arguments are not disambiguated on error
  propagation
  expressions](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/issues/3001)

Our error propagation expressions (expressions which use the question
mark operator, of the form `<expr>?`) are currently forgotten in many of
our AST visitors. As a result, there are unexpected cases when it comes
to various parts of the compiler pipeline handling them. In that
particular case, the function call's generic arguments are not
disambiguated - the compiler does not know if it needs to be handling a
generic type, or a const generic value. You will need to add handling to
our name resolution pass for these error propagation expressions. It
would be helpful to look at [the current generic
disambiguation](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/75049a3bfee8c3f888994bce3b741a805c631c2a/gcc/rust/resolve/rust-ast-resolve-type.cc#L568)
to start figuring out where it is called from, and where you need to
call it.
