## Overview

Thanks again to [Open Source Security, inc](https://opensrcsec.com/) and
[Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com/) for their ongoing support for this
project.

### Milestone Progress

We spent the majority of our time this month preparing patches, or
fixing them after receiving reviews on the mailing lists. Some of these
patches take a long time to upstream and review, as they touch common
complex parts of the GCC project such as the build system, which we are
currently fighting with to integrate a new `libgrust` folder containing
various libraries useful to `gccrs`, such as those related to our
procedural macros implementation. These patches are necessary to
upstream before the rest of the work done this year, as intrinsic
compiler features have been moved to this directory. Once this is done,
we will be able to simply push the new patches upstream, after short
modifications to make them more suitable to the upstream GCC project. At
the moment, there are around 900 patches being prepared, with the hope
of pushing them before the end of the month. We are also exploring
solutions to help automate this process a little more, as it represents
very time consuming work which we would like to avoid in the future -
keeping `upstream` up to date with our development repository, with
weekly or bi-weekly updates, should prove worthwhile in the long term.

On the technical side, a lot of bugs were fixed this month again thanks
to our contributor team. [Jakub Dupak](https://github.com/jdupak) has
been making some amazing progress on borrow-checking in `gccrs`, with
the development of a new, simplified intermediate representation
specifically designed to interact with the polonius borrow-checker. At
the moment, our compiler can start emitting simple errors, such as "use
after move" errors, or simple lifetime analysis, which we are really
excited for.

We also got in touch with the GCC release maintainers to understand what
was expected of `gccrs` for it to be an integral part of the GCC 14.1
release, and should be able to fulfill the requirements (`println!()`
macro, simple Rust examples working…). We are very excited for everyone
to be able to try the compiler.

Finally, October also saw Pierre-Emmanuel and Arthur go to EuroRust,
where they had an amazing time. We are looking forward to coming back
next year. We gave a small talk on the compiler, and the challenges of
compiling the standard Rust library, which we will link to once
released.

### Community call

We will have our next monthly community call on the 13th of November
2023. You can subscribe to our calendar to see when the next one will be
held. The call is open to everyone, even if you would just like to
sit-in and listen. You can also subscribe to our
[mailing-list](https://gcc.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcc-rust) or join
our [Zulip chat](https://gcc-rust.zulipchat.com) to be notified of
upcoming events.
